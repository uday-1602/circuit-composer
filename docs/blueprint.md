# **App Name**: Circuit Composer

## Core Features:

- Circuit Design Canvas: Visual circuit composer for designing quantum circuits by dragging and dropping gates.
- Gate Library: Display of available quantum gates with descriptions and tooltips.
- Qubit Connections: Ability to connect gates with qubits via visual lines.
- Export Circuit: Ability to export the circuit as a text representation such as QASM code.
- AI Circuit Assistant: AI-powered suggestion tool: The app recommends the next gate or sequence of gates to optimize the circuit based on the current state and target function.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of technological sophistication and depth.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure contrast with the quantum circuit design elements, and to align with a light scheme.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#8F00FF), slightly lighter and more saturated than the primary color, to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a clean, modern user interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying QASM code and circuit representation.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for gates and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable and distinct.
- Divide the layout into distinct panels: a gate library on one side, a canvas in the center, and settings on the other.
