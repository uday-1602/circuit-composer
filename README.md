# Quantum Circuit Composer
**A web-based visual editor for designing and simulating quantum circuits, built with React, Tailwind CSS**
<<<<<<< HEAD

**Features:**

  ~Drag-and-drop interface for adding quantum gates.

  ~View the quantum state in visualizations like the Bloch Sphere and State Probabilities.

  ~View the circuit simultaneously in OpenQASM format.

  ~Includes all standard gates (H, X, Y, Z, S, T, CNOT, Measure).



**Tech Stack:**

  ~Frontend: React & Next.js

  ~Styling: Tailwind CSS

  ~State Management/Core Logic: linear algebra for easier user access to results

  ~Backend/Hosting: Vercel

  ~Version Control: Git & GitHub
